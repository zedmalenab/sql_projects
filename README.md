# üîç Background

The demand for data professionals‚Äîespecially Data Analysts‚Äîcontinues to grow across industries. With vast amounts of job postings available online, understanding which skills are most sought-after and which roles offer competitive salaries can help aspiring analysts focus their learning effectively.

This project dives into job market data to answer key questions such as:
- What are the top-paying roles for Data Analysts?
- Which technical skills are most in demand for remote analyst positions?
- How do skillsets correlate with average salaries across job listings?

By using SQL to join, filter, group, and analyze job posting datasets, this project delivers actionable insights for career planning and data-driven decision-making. It also showcases the power of SQL in transforming raw data into meaningful information.



# üõ†Ô∏è Tools I Used

- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Used as the primary database for querying and analyzing the data.
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** ‚Äì My go-to code editor for writing and testing SQL queries with extension support for PostgreSQL and SQL syntax highlighting.

These tools provided a powerful and efficient environment for exploring data, building queries, and drawing insights from structured datasets.

#  The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the example data analyst job market dataset:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs:
- To identify top paying jobs I filtered Data Analyst Positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on work from home jobs. This query highlights top paying data analyst job that offers work from home.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    company_dim.name,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim
    ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id

WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_work_from_home = true AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC

LIMIT 10

```
Here are the breakdowns of the query above:
- üíº **Senior and leadership roles** (e.g., Director, Principal Analyst) command the highest salaries, reflecting the value of experience and strategic impact in data-driven decision-making.  
- üè¢ **Top-tier companies** like Meta, AT&T, and Pinterest offer premium compensation, especially for roles tied to business insights and product analytics.  
- üåç **Remote and hybrid roles** dominate the high-paying list, highlighting flexibility as a standard in modern, high-level data analyst positions.

## 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
- To identify the skills for top paying jobs I joined job postings data with skills data providing emplpoyers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
-- identifying top paying job skills from the previous table using CTE --
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    company_dim.name,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim
    ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id

WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC

)

SELECT
    skills_dim.skills,
    top_paying_jobs.*
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS skill_to_job
    ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skill_to_job.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim
    ON skill_to_job.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id

ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC

LIMIT 25
```
Here are the breakdowns of the query above:

#  What I learned
Throughout making this project as a computer engineering graduate trying to go into data analytics:

- **üß© Complex Query Crafting: ** I learned thoroughly the advanced SQL function, merging tables, and using CTEs for more advance table merging.

- **üìà Data Aggregation: ** I can say I am comfortable on using GROUP BY and turned aggregate functions like COUNT() and AVG as my asernal in data summarizing.
- **ü§Ø Analytical Skill: ** With practive problems I found in different courses and internet like. I came up to answer different questions using different dataset to show my analytical skills.
